Do you think somebody could say that ‘numbers’🔢 are ‘the love of my life’💖?

Well, I do! ⬅

I started my relationship with ‘numbers’ long time ago. Back in school Math was my ‘hero’🐱‍🏍. Solving all those mathematical quizzes and problems 🕵️‍♀️ was super exciting for me ✨ and I wanted more and more of Math. This is how I ended up studying Economics and International Trade👩‍🎓. I was a bit disappointed that there is not so much of a Math in Economics, but Economics became my second ‘hero’ 🐱‍🏍because of all the analysis we were doing. 
After my studies I started working in the Taxation area but I was missing something because there's not so much ‘numbers’ there, there's more laws and forms to be filled in 😞. Since I was not able to get in a strong relationship with the 'love of my life' (to be specific: math and data analysis) I decided to end it 💔and started to search for something new. During this search I've got a chance to take a course of Data Analytics in Turing College to see if that's the match ✅❓. And it seems to be a match 💘, a perfect match💥. The only thing which is missing for this story to have a happy ending 🔚 is the company where we could meet and dive deep into this super strong relationship. 

Have an offer for a date?🙌 Let’s see how the story will end? 🌟✨💫🌃
